    Templates🏛️
    1. Markdown:A plain text format for writing structured documents, based on conventions for indicating formatting in email and usenet posts.GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) is the most popular dialect if Markdown currently supported on GitHub and other sites.

    2.Liquid:Safe open-source template language created by Shopify. It uses a combination of objects, tags, and filters inside template files to display dynamic content.

    3.Nunjucks:A rich and powerful templating language for JavaScript with block inheritance, autoescaping, macros, asynchronous control, and more. Available in node and all modern web browsers, with thorough precompilation options.

    4.Largely compatible with Mustache templates, provides the power necessary to let you build semantic templates effectively with no frustration. Compiling templates into JavaScript functions makes the template execution faster than most other template engines.

    5.Mustache:A logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code, anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

    6.EJS:A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It’s just plain JavaScript.

    7.Haml:Avoids the need for explicitly coding HTML into the template, because it itself is a description of the HTML, with some code to generate dynamic content.

    8.pug:Formerly known as “Jade”. A clean, whitespace sensitive syntax for writing HTML.

    9.jinja:A fast, expressive, extensible templating engine. Special placeholders in the template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. Then the template is passed data to render the final document.
