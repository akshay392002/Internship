<!-- CSS(cascading style sheet)
    **Child Selector:

    suppose there is paragraph in div tag to apply style to that para we can use

    div > p{color:blue}  //for this child selector it applies only if the element is direct child .


    **Decendent selector: for child which is direct also indirect child.
    div p{color:pink}

    **Universal selector: Applies on all the elements
    *{color:red}

    **Pseudo selector: used for anchor tag
    a:visited{color:blue}
    a:link{}
    a:active{}
    a:hover{}

    p:first-child{color:green;}   //apply color green on first child of parent i.e to only first paragraph.If there are two para then it applies to only first one.
    p:last-child{color:yellow;}     //apply color yellow on last child


    ***Box model📦
    We can add multiple classes to one element
    <div class="box box1"></div>

    if we add some height to element lets suppose 200px so for total heigth we must add border and padding to it, but if we add "box-sizing:border-box" then total height is 200px including border and padding i.e its suppose border + padding is 5 then content height is 195. Without it only content height is 200px.

    If margin of two elements collapsing then css only applies maximum margin value  between them.

    font-weight:73 //use to make text bold or light
    line-height: //space between two lines and by default is 110 to 120%
    leeter-spacing //space between letters
    text-transform: Capitalize(to make first letter capital) or uppercase or lowercase (for entire string)
    text-decoration:underline;
    text-decoration-color:; //This colors above underline
    text-decoration-style:dotted; //dotted underline
    text-decoration-thickness: //Thickness of underline
    text-indent

    text-overflow: (clip/ellipsis (means ...)) //If content not fits in window it either elips it or clips it
    overflow: hidden;  //hides extra part 

    word-break:break-all; //breaks the word at the end of the line

    text-align:center;

    *If same selector like multiple classes applying color on text then the selector which is mentioned at last in style is applied. Because last means we changed it recently.
    Order of selectors priority:
    inline(1000) > id(100) > class or attribute selector(like href) or pseudo class(like hover)(10) > Element selector(like h1,p)(1)) > universal(*)(0 points)
    we can add !important to make any selector highest priority
    p{color:blue !important}
    h1.className = 1+10(h1+class) = 11 specificity

    🚑Font size units:::

    **If we want to use reponsive height or width using "vw" as a unit is a good choice. It takes viewport with into consideration.Doest't get affected when screen size changes.
    80vw means 80% of total height

    ** when we use margin:auto it will center block elements.

    **em means suppose child is going to get some 20px font size then use 2em for child then it will double inherited one i.e 40px
     
    **rem is same but it compares to root element

    **min-width,max-width : minimum or maximum width/height is set and not changes with respect to content.

    **we can not put div inside p

    Display property🖥️
        display:inline //block elements displayed inline
        Above causes problem while setting width and margin to solve this use as these not work on inline elements as block
        display : inline-block;

        display:none //removes element along with space taken
        visibility:hidden //hides element but space is there


    🔳Shadows and Outlines
    box-shadow: horizontal-offset vertical-offset blur spread color inset(how much inside the block ) ;
    text-shadow:; // to add an shadow to text

    outline: width style color;

    📃Styling lists
    display: list-item; //default property for list
    list-style-position:inside | outside; //where the marker should be placed (before|after) to apply style
    list-style-imag:url(""); //used to image as index
    list-style-type: "🫏";
    list-style:none; //to remove index
